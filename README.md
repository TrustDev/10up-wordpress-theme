# Front End Recruiting Exercise

Thank you for taking the time to do this exercise!

The objective of this exercise to do an audit of https://exercises.10up.com. Here is the WordPress login information:

Username: `candidate`, Password: `*7GYese%75Q!1%t0$l55bXiC`

Your audit should document all the issues you can find specifically around UX / UI (e.g. something doesn't look right), CSS best practices/code quality, JavaScript best practices/code quality, accessibility, and performance. Look for all the problems you can find. We've hidden quite a few of them. 

The format of your audit can be a simple document or spreadsheet. You should not spend more than 2 hours on the exercise.


Here's an example of the kind of issues we're looking for:

| Component | Category | Issue
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Site header | UI | Brief description of issue |
| General | JS | Brief description of issue |
| CTA Grid (side-by-side images) | Accessibility | Brief description of issue |
| Frequently Asked Questions | CSS | Brief description of issue |

Submit your completed audit to jobs@10up.com


Good luck!
